# Smart Magic Cards
Join Smart by performing a simple magic trick.

### Requirements
- Make sure all 4 suits of cards are rendered. There are 13 cards in each suit (â™¥,   â™£, â™¦, â™ )
- Add 3 buttons to the flow that will do 3 actions:
  - **Shuffle** Randomly shuffles all cards
  - **Show/Hide** Hide all the cards by adding a class (CSS is already included)
  - **Magic** Order the cards again by suite

#### Bonus points
  - Find a way to automatically create all the classes for the cards: `.hearts-1`, `.hearts-2`, ... , `.spades-13`
  - Make sure the value for each card is visible on the inital render, basically move each card a bit so the card is readable
  - Add animation
  - Remove all images and have the cards represented with CSS only
  - Add some extra functionality, this is your chance to be creative ðŸ˜‰
